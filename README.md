# CityFix

## UNIVESP's Integrative Project III

### Project Overview

CityFix is a digital platform that enables citizens to report and track urban maintenance requests, streamlining communication between the community and responsible government agencies. The platform serves as an accessible and intuitive tool for users to report urban issues such as potholes, burned-out streetlights, public cleaning problems, and more, centralizing these demands in a single system.

### Goals

- Improve urban maintenance management by making the process more agile, efficient, and transparent
- Enable citizens to monitor the progress of their requests and receive automatic status notifications
- Allow public agencies to track and prioritize maintenance tasks in an organized manner
- Implement a feedback system for better interaction between citizens and public administration

### Vision

This platform aims to transform urban management by making cities smarter and more responsive to citizens' needs, promoting active community participation in improving the urban environment. CityFix contributes to the modernization of public administration by integrating technology and citizenship for a more efficient city that's better connected with its residents.
